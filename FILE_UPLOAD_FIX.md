# File Upload Fix

This document explains the changes made to fix the "Multipart: Boundary not found" error when uploading files.

## The Problem

When attempting to upload files from the frontend to the backend, you encountered the following error:

```
Multipart: Boundary not found
```

This happened because:
1. In the frontend, we were manually setting `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` which wasn't including the necessary boundary parameter
2. The busboy implementation in the backend needed improvements to handle file uploads properly

## The Solution

### Frontend Changes

1. **Removed manual Content-Type header**: When using FormData, browsers automatically set the correct Content-Type header with the boundary. We removed our manual header setting to let the browser handle it.

```javascript
// Before (problematic)
return apiClient.post('/files/upload', formData, {
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data', // This was the problem!
  },
});

// After (fixed)
return apiClient.post('/files/upload', formData, {
  headers: {
    // Let the browser set the Content-Type with boundary
  },
});
```

### Backend Changes

1. **Improved file upload plugin**: Enhanced the busboy implementation with better error handling and logging.
2. **Simplified file handling**: Removed the streaming approach in favor of a simpler buffer-based approach.
3. **Added detailed logging**: Added more logging to help diagnose any future issues.

## How to Test

1. Restart your backend server
2. Restart your frontend development server
3. Try uploading a file from the user interface
4. Check the backend logs for the following successful messages:
   - "Processing file upload: [filename]"
   - "File upload complete: [filename], size: [size] bytes"
   - "File received: [filename], size: [size] bytes"

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter further issues:

1. Check the browser console for network errors
2. Check the backend logs for error messages
3. Verify that the file size is within the allowed limit (default: 50MB)
4. Ensure that the storage directory exists and is writable
